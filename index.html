  <section id="about">
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a first-year undergraduate at MIT planning to major in mathematics and computer science, perhaps with a concentration in artificial intelligence. My interest in these fields started after my experience at the MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute at the end of 9th grade, where I got a taste of using reinforcement learning in simulated games. After that, I dove into my own projects and watched videos about bias in machine learning algorithms, which sparked a deeper interest in AI Safety. Since then, I've been passionate about building systems that not only perform well but are also safe and ethical. </p>

    <p>
        Outside of academics, I also enjoy playing games on my virtual reality headset and reading funny stories, which helps me unwind after intense study sessions. </p>
        
    <p>
        In the future, I hope to continue working on projects that combine my love for AI with real-world impact, ensuring technology is developed responsibly.
